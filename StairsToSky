# i suppose i can see how one would think this was not in-scope of class material. but im not sure. there isnt any function definitions, like i normally would do. maybe it was the nested loops, but either way, i will try my hardest, to again simplify the code.

# as always, get the turtle module.

import turtle

# make the screen so we can see it
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("white")
wn.title("Stairway to the Sky")

# now we define what turtle is 
t = turtle.Turtle()
t.speed(0)  # basically a V8 twinturbo'd engine

# where will the turtle start?
t.penup()
t.goto(-200, -200)
t.pendown()

# move 20 steps. the first 10 will be red, and the next 10 will be blue
for step in range(20):
    if step < 10:
        t.color("red")
    else:
        t.color("blue")
    
    t.forward(30)  # goes forward
    t.left(90)
    t.forward(30)  # goes up
    t.right(90)

# we must go to the place where we want to draw the starburst
t.penup()
t.forward(30)
t.left(90)
t.forward(30)
t.pendown()

# make a square rotated 20 degrees each time to make a starburst shape thingy
# uses a simple loop to rotate and draw (i cant make it any simpler.)
t.color("black") #best color bar none
for turn in range(18):  # 360 / 20 = 18 steps
    for side in range(4):  # will draw a square
        t.forward(100)
        t.right(90)
    t.right(20)

# lets keep the window open
wn.mainloop()
