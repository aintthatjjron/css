# once again, my code was said to be AI, for using arguably the best options in functions in terms of definitive loops, and such. i will try my best to write this, in the simplest way i can.

 

# get turtle module

import turtle

# this will set up the screen for the thing
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("white")
wn.title("Triangle Drawer")

# we must define "turtle" is
tri = turtle.Turtle()
tri.speed(1)

# whats the largest number a user can enter?
maxValue = 250

# ask for a side length
side = int(input("Enter a number less than or equal to " + str(maxValue) + ": "))

# which color? what to draw
if side > maxValue:
    tri.color("black")
    side = 50
else:
    if side >= 0 and side <= 100:
        tri.color("red")
    elif side >= 101 and side <= 200:
        tri.color("blue")
    elif side >= 201 and side <= maxValue:
        tri.color("green")

# now, we obviously have to draw  the triangle (equilateral: all sides equal, 120 degree turns)
tri.penup()
tri.goto(0, 0)
tri.setheading(0)
tri.pendown()

for i in range(3):
    tri.forward(side)
    tri.left(120)

# lets keep the window open
wn.mainloop()

# this is genuinly the simplest that i am able to put this request.
